This is our Mastermind Game challenge implementation and our explanation to how build it.

Our team group is:

  * David Orejuela
  * Emma Navarro
  * Santiago Pe√±a
  * Nathaly Sotomayor Ampudia
  
### Initial requirements

  * Python 2.7 or greater
  * Tkinter GUI library
  * Xming Server (Windows OS) or another graphic interface handler according to your OS
  * Configure your system to handle graphic interface applications  
 
### Download and Installation

You must have `git` installed

Open the command line interface and clone the repository:

  `git clone` [https://github.com/daorejuela1/mastermind.git](https://github.com/daorejuela1/mastermind.git)
  
### Usage

Go to the repository folder and execute `main.py`

  ```bash
  cmd/mastermind~$ ./main.py
  ```

### :scroll: Rules

Your aim is to crack the code fast enough to get a high score and make it onto our Master Code Breakers list.

You get 8 attempts at breaking the code. If you can't discover it by then then you lose that game. But that's ok. You can get a new code and try again.

The Code Breaker code is made up of 4 to 6 colours from the 8 available colours. To win you must place the right marbles in the right order. After each attempt you will be told how you went.

:white_circle: **White marble** - Means that there is one of your marbles in the code but not in the right place.

:black_circle: **Black marble** - Means that there is one of your marbles in the code and in the right place.
