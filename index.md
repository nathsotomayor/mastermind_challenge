## Mastermind Game

Mordechai Meirowitz, an Israeli telephone technician, developed Mastermind in 1970 from an existing game of apocryphal origin, Bulls and Cows, which used
numbers instead of colored pegs. Nobody, by the way, knows where Bulls and Cows came from. Computer scientists who adapted the first known versions in the
1960s variously remembered the game to me as one hundred and one thousand years old. Whatever its age, itâ€™s clear nobody ever did as well out
of Bulls and Cows as Meirowitz, who retired from game development and lived comfortably off royalties not long after selling the Mastermind prototype to
Invicta, a British plastics firm expanding from industrial parts and window shutters into games and toys.
