### Rules

Your aim is to crack the code fast enough to get a high score and make it onto our Master Code Breakers list.

You get 8 attempts at breaking the code. If you can't discover it by then then you lose that game. But that's ok. You can get a new code and try again.

The Code Breaker code is made up of 4 to 6 colours from the 8 available colours. To win you must place the right marbles in the right order. After each attempt you will be told how you went.

**White marble** - Means that there is one of your marbles in the code but not in the right place.

**Black marble** - Means that there is one of your marbles in the code and in the right place.
